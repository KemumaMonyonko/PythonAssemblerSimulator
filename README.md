# Assembler and simulator in python
The project contains an assembler and simulator written in python. <br/>
The assembler takes input and transforms it into binary. <br/>
The simulator steps in to accept the output of the assembler and execute it correctly.

# About the project
Five registers; R1,R2,R3, program counter and a conditional register are used. <br/>
Machine instructions are encoded in half word in little endian.


# Running the project
Switch to either the simulator or assembler directory. <br/>
Click on ./run on bash or alternatively run the simulator.py or assembler.py directly.
